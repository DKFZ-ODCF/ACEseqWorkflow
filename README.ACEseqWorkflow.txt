Switch                      Default Description
SV                          true    By default, the workflow will try to use an SV file for breakpoints
allowMissingSVFile          false   Allows the workflow to stop without an error, if the SV file does not exist
runWithCrest          		false   Run with crest output
runQualityCheckOnly      	false   Stop the workflow after the gc correction.
runMetaCNVGeneration        false   Run a meta step for the cnv generation. This submits a single,
									slightly optimized step instead of several (per chromosome) jobs.
isNoControlWorkflow	        false   Run analysis with matching control and estimate control genotypes based on tumor BAF

== Changelist

* Version update 6.0.0
- Changed the phasing routine. The program "impute2" was replaced by "Beagle". Files and tools were renamed accordingly.
- Generally renamed all tools and files from "imputeGenotype" to "phaseGenotype" (and so on) as the subroutine does not actually perform imputation but rather phasing.

* Todo
- after segment merging: assign proper SNP values (majority vote)``
- LST score: gap centromere region even if A/B levels are not identical, or relax neighboring-condition
- LST score: decide transition on A/B counts (and not only TCN change) (example: WGS H021-RF6GGV Chr10)
						 discuss in beforehand: Shall changes in A/B values (with identical TCN counts) contribute to LST score or not?
						 e.g. 2/2 -> 3/1 or 4/0
				if so, A/B column can contain "sub". Hence, we cannot distinguish between e.g. c1Mean=3.45 (->sub(3)) and c1Mean=8.55 (->sub(8)), as they
are both called "sub" only. Idea: call them "sub([floor(c1Mean)])". (same holds for c2Mean)
discuss with Matthias: use c1Mean or A? Why did we decide to take A (round(c1Mean)) and not c1Mean directly? (answer: biological interpretation)
